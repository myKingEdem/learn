This is a collection of all programs written during my self-directed summer programming immersion, where I gave myself 3 months to go from hobbyist to junior dev.
You can read my reflections on my personal blog, [www.rkcudjoe.com](http://www.rkcudjoe.com).
Go through the programs at your own risk!!!
