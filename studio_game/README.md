This exercise was completed during Pragmatic Studio's Online Ruby Course.
Run ```ruby studio_game.rb``` to play the game.
You can also load you own CSV file, containing the names and initial lives of players.
In that case, you would play the game by running ```ruby studio_game.rb playerlist.csv```.
Have fun with it!!!
